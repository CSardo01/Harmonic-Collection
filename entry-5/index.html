                <p class="body-copy">This week's Entry goes over my thoughts and opinions on windows that move!
                    Specifically train windows!
                <p class="body-copy">Trains have always been an interest of mine specifically passenger train design,
                    and when im bored I catch myself watching videos of Trainzswhizzing by. One aspect of a train's
                    design that I find intresting is its windows.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Windows on trains vary quite a bit but their design and shape until recently seemed
                    to be dictated by continent as there seems to be a huge difference in train window designs on
                    American, European, and Japanese trains. Impart these design choices can be traced to different
                    prices of legislation and solutions to problems that arose in each county</p>

                <p class="body-copy">Windows on American trains typically are small and narrow, along with having
                    rounded corners, For example, the Amfleet coach car debuted in the 70s. This design choice might be
                    a nod to an earlier design movement called streamlining which was popular in the 30s as well as Old
                    Federal Safety Regulations that required American passenger trains to reach a certain level of crash
                    survivability and as windows became smaller.
                <p class="body-copy">However Recently these safety regulations have been altered allowing more for more
                    trains to be easily imported. Despite this trains Made in the US still seem to adhere to the
                    previous design stands, as with the case of the MTA M9 Rail Cars which entered service in 2019, and
                    the R211 Subway cars which have not yet entered service. the r211 specifically shrunk the windows
                    down to make room for larger doors however there are easier, in my opinion, there are better design
                    alternatives that could have been taken into account.</p>

                    While im, 'm not the biggest fan of these windows I have to admit there is a sort
                    of utilitarian charm that makes the design of the whole train feel timeless or even sci-fi. Or
                    perhaps I have a special attachment to these windows as I've spent countless hours staring out them
                    on the subway and train rides back home.</p>

                    Europe has been at the forefront of train design with some of the largest train manufacturers in constant competition. In addition Rail in Europe is more passenger oriented when compared to the U.S, and as a result, trains are lighter and have much larger windows. Such as the TGV Sud-Est which came out around the same time as the Amfleet coach. </p>

                    Interestingly These larger windows have been a staple on traditionaly non-highspeed trains as well, especially on metro and subways. For example, the entire door of a Berlin U-Bahn Train is a window. it's possible that these larger windows exist to create a lighter and more open aesthetic in an attempt to increase a feeling of swiftness and speed.

                    Both Europe and America have had unique designs when it comes to train windows and resulting aesthetics, however, the line is starting to get blurred as US Federal Regulations Change, and funding from the infrastructure bill allows Amtrak to update its rolling stock. For Example, the New Acela is the same model of train as the New TGVs in France even with the same window shape and layout. Amtrak has also recently bought new German-designed Siemens venture coaches with much larger windows, a departure from the Amfleet coaches of the past 50 years.

                    As to which type of windows I prefer the larger more European models of trains as I think they're more well suited to staring out of on long and monotonous train rides, so im happy to see them become more commonplace here in North America.
