        <p class="section-body">This is a window, I can see through it since it has a frame that holds in transparent glass. It can even open, removing the glass as a barrier. </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">This is also a window.</h2>
        <p class="section-body">All be it, a very old window. It has a mullion and frame but it doesn't have glass. However, I can still see through it, and therefore it's also considered a window. </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">This is a screen.</h2>
        <p class="section-body">Screens can also be considered a window. screens are transparent, have glass, and typically have some sort of frame around them or bezel.

        <h2 class="section-title">What else is a window?.</h2>
        <p class="section-body">All the previous examples had two things in common. First, you can see through them, and second, they had some sort of frame. So in theory what else could you call a window... perhaps a bagel.
