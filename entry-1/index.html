  <h3>These Windows! The ones not built by Microsoft.</h3>

  <p class="body-copy">
    At first, the operating system and the architectural element seem like separate entities. They are in fact more
    closely related, both offering glimpses into alternate spaces.
  </p>

  <h3>Similarly, a building without windows gives off a sorta MS-DOS vibe.</h3>
 
  <div class="two-img-grid">
    <Img alt="33 Thomas Street NYC" src="../entry-1/entry-1 imgs/NYC Windows/5NYC windows.JPG">
    <Img alt="Screen With MS-DOS" src="../entry-1/entry-1 imgs/Dos.JPG">
  </div>

  <p class="body-copy">
    While both the building and MS-DOS have a certain aesthetic, They seem inaccessible to the general public. In fact,
    33 Thomas street was the AT&T Long Lines building, however, it has also been speculated to be the headquarters of an
    NSA mass surveillance hub. Ironically the MS-DOS/Terminal aesthetic is often used to represent hacking in popular
    culture.

    <h2>Why windows?</h2>
    <P class="body-copy">
      Truthfully it was one of the first things that popped into my mind. However, upon further contemplation, I
      realized that there's alot to unpack. There's the physicality of windows and what they're made of. For example how
      reflective the pane of glass is. However, there is also the more metaphorical aspect of windows and how they make
      us feel psychological.
